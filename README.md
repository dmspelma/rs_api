This repo is designed to house functions for Runescape and Runescape Wiki.

The `playerExp` class is able to gather hiscore information for any player provided they exist on the hiscores.

The `comparator` class is able to compare two existing places and pit their skills against each other.

To search wiki from command line, a script `rsw.sh` is provided. This could be moved into local `~/bin` for ease of use.
